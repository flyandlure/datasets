Role: Resourcer, Data, Analytics & Data Science
Location: Tunbridge Wells office post pandemic - you’d likely only be coming here twice a week. The rest is work from home, and will be 100% remote for the time being
Salary: £18,000 - £28,000 (DoE)
Benefits: 20 days annual leave rising to 25, placement and target bonuses, life assurance, workplace pension scheme, Employee Assistance Program, health insurance, healthcare cash plan
The job of a resourcer is to locate and engage the right talent for a vacancy, as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Whilst this sounds simple, it can be a challenge.
Imagine you’ve got 6 vacancies with the same deadline. Each needs a shortlist of 4 people. Those people need to be attracted or pro-actively engaged before the week is done.
Worst case, you could be looking for 24 different people, each with rare skills… across hundreds of millions of people to find them.
Then you’ve got other calls for catch ups, interview debriefs, offers to close plus a ton of other people to get back to with feedback.
So it’s fair to say this is a job juggling a lot of balls, constantly looking at solving problems, dealing with a product which at times can be irrational and unpredictable - as it’s people.
THE ROLE
You’ll be joining our team who look after all things Data recruitment related. Reporting into the team leader and supporting them with what is a high volume desk.
The kind of roles you’ll be supporting on require very specialist skills, and the talent in those areas are in incredibly high demand. So to be successful you’ve got to be credible. Great at networking and building relationships with people.
It’s a market which operates at real pace because of the level of demand. Which means you can expect quick turnarounds and deadlines on projects and a constant flow of new requirements given to you which need delivering to.
The team you’ll be joining is fronted by someone who’s got a very strong presence and status in the market, and is a trusted partner to a wide range of businesses. From high street and unicorn digital retailers and dot coms. Technology firms, data and analytics consultancies and some of the biggest names in global marketing, digital and data agencies.
In addition to the tasks outlined in the opening paragraphs, you’ll be networking with industry specialists. Building rapport and relationships in order to effectively build engagement. Looking to gain referrals and recommendations from these too.
Managing candidate experience end to end, ensuring everyone gets an appropriately high quality one. Delivered with upmost respect and professionalism.
There’s also some client facing aspects to the role too. Managing the recruitment process from CV submissions, chasing feedback, arranging interviews as well as offer and onboarding processes.
THE COMPANY
Blue Pelican has been around for 18 years. We survived the financial crisis of 2008, multiple recessions and we’re doing the same again, despite what can be perceived as challenging conditions.
How we’ve done this is a testament to our people and our Values.
Internally the team reshaped to work even more collaboratively, focussed on ensuring our clients hired the talent they needed with as little pain as possible
We created new services and advised on best practice for hiring in a newly on-line only capacity
We supported candidates with their job search, even if it wasn’t through us
In short, we worked tirelessly to create opportunity where it sometimes felt like there wasn’t any.
Just look at our YouTube channels for example.
What we’re experiencing now is a dramatic upturn in demand, brought on through a mix of new client wins and a return to hiring for some of our largest loyal clients. So we’re coming out of this stronger than ever, and this is why we need your help.
KEY EXPERIENCE
Ideally we are looking for someone with experience of working as a resourcer before. If you’ve got this, you already know what skills you need to demonstrate.
However, we will also consider relevant transferable skills.
There’s a few common traits of good resourcers, and it’s these:
- Gregarious characters, happy to pick up the phone and chat with people
- Good research skills. But also don’t bog themselves down in data. They’re quick to spot what they need then reach out to those people to engage
- Bright and switched on. Able to understand the complexities of people and their skills. Looking beyond technical limitations and can see how they could adapt to a client’s need successfully
- Brilliant time management skills - especially with multiple deadline juggling
- Able to react at pace to things which need quick turnarounds
- Very organised - plate spinning is something of a speciality
- Great EQ - able to puts the candidate and client needs first
- Real team player - recognises the part they play in helping the team become more than the sum of its parts
- But is also commercially savvy enough to know when they might be pushing a dead horse
If you’re an experienced hand and looking to command the higher end of the salary spectrum on offer - in support of your application, why don’t you email me and tell me the following:

THE OPPORTUNITY
With investment from the top into data and all its uses, this is an exciting time to be joining the company and they look to understand and explore their customer’s behaviours and relationships with the brand in more detail than ever before. As always, there is the challenge of educating and liberating existing stakeholders across many different functions within this fashion giant as to the possibilities of data driven decision making and actionable insights - which is where this role comes in.
Working as part of a team of data experts across customer analytics, product, marketing, finance and customer service, you will focus on delivering reports, self service analytics and insights around customer service and operations for the group. You will report into the Customer Service Analytics Manager and will both work to build relationships with key stakeholders in the call centres, supply chain logistics and carrier management departments to understand their needs, challenges and potential for using data to improve decision making. In this role, we’ll need people with natural intellectual curiosity to go beyond the basics of just building out regular reports, and expect you to provide proactive insights and commentary on the data analysed.
This role requires hands on SQL programming skills, plus knowledge and demonstrable experience with a reporting tool such as Power BI, Tableau or Qlikview (the latter being the tool they currently use in house). There is huge opportunity for personal and technical growth and development within this role, as the business accelerates its data function into the modern age, embracing AI and machine learning techniques where appropriate as well as step changing the influence data has on decisioning across the group of brands. They have already invested in a cloud based platform (GCP) and are very open to using open source tech such as R and Python for more advanced analytical solutions and projects.
The culture is fast paced, young and agile, and with double digit growth YOY, this company continues to lead the way in fast fashion. But with the inevitable slowing of such growth on the horizon, there is an agenda to make the brand unique and distinctive, by tapping into the data and through the use of analytics and data science.
Skills and experience required:
Educated to at degree level in a numerate subject; Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Machine Learning, Computer Science etc.
At least intermediate coding skills using SQL for data analysis, manipulation and extraction
Proven experience using a reporting and data visualisation tool such as Power BI, Tableau or Qlikview for building engaging and interactive dashboards
Exposure to big data sets (millions) and ideally some experience of working in a cloud based environment; Azure, AS or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong communication and relationship building skills - you will be business facing and working to develop relationships in multiple departments
A curious nature, and inquisitive nature with the ability to spot commercial opportunity to use data to improve business or product performance"

THE OPPORTUNITY
With investment from the top into data and all its uses, this is an exciting time to be joining the company and they look to understand and explore their customer’s behaviours and relationships with the brand in more detail than ever before. As always, there is the challenge of educating and liberating existing stakeholders across many different functions within this fashion giant as to the possibilities of data driven decision making and actionable insights - which is where this role comes in.
With investment from the top into data and all its uses, this is an exciting time to be joining the company and they look to understand and explore their customer’s behaviours and relationships with the brand in more detail than ever before. As always, there is the challenge of educating and liberating existing stakeholders across many different functions within this fashion giant as to the possibilities of data driven decision making and actionable insights - which is where this role comes in.
Working as part of a team of data experts across customer analytics, product, marketing, finance and customer service, you will focus on delivering reports, self service analytics and actionable insights around customer and marketing performance for the group. You will have one direct report initially and will both work to build relationships with key stakeholders in many departments to understand their needs, challenges and potential for using data to improve decision making around customer behaviour and engagement, churn and retention, acquisition as well as marketing performance across multiple channels (predominantly digital). In this brand new role, we’ll need people with natural intellectual curiosity to go beyond the basics and establish the best way of measuring and improving marketing performance through test and learn frameworks and coming up with innovative and creative ideas around engaging and targeting customers, use data generated through the website, app and other channels such as CRM, third party, transactional and warehouse to do this.
This role still requires hands on customer and marketing analytics skills (SQL as a minimum), as with any opportunity that arises through change, you will need to bridge the gap between what they are currently doing now and where they are aiming to get to - working to build out capabilities and eventually a bigger team. So, there is huge opportunity for personal and technical growth and development within this role, as the business accelerates it’s data function into the modern age, embracing AI and machine learning techniques where appropriate. They have already invested in a cloud based platform (GCP) and are very open to using open source tech such as R and Python for more advanced analytical solutions and projects - all of which will be led by you, from a customer and marketing perspective.
The culture is fast paced, young and agile, and with double digit growth YOY, this trail blazer continues to lead the way in fast fashion. But with the inevitable slowing of such growth on the horizon, there is an agenda to make the brand unique and distinctive, by tapping into the data and through the use of analytics and data science.
Skills and experience required:
Educated to at least degree level in a numerate subject; Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Machine Learning, Computer Science etc.
A strong background in customer and marketing analytics
Strong programming skills using SQL as a minimum for campaign analysis, measurement and targeting (campaign selections)
A problem solving approach, ability to apply analytics to improve customer understanding and in turn CRM and marketing campaign performance
A curious nature, and inquisitive nature plus an ability to build strong relationships with direct reports and senior level stakeholders"

With investment from the top into data and all its uses, this is an exciting time to be joining the company and they look to understand and explore their customer’s behaviours and relationships with the brand in more detail than ever before. As always, there is the challenge of educating and liberating existing stakeholders across many different functions within this fashion giant as to the possibilities of data driven decision making and actionable insights – which is where this role comes in.
Working as part of a team of data experts across customer analytics, product, marketing, finance and customer service, you will focus on delivering reports, self service analytics and insights around product performance for the group.
You will have one direct report initially and will both work to build relationships with key stakeholders in buying, merchandising and finance to understand their needs, challenges and potential for using data to improve decision making around demand forecasting, customer engagement and in turn commercial product performance. In this role, we’ll need people with natural intellectual curiosity to go beyond the basics and establish the best way of measuring and improving product performance and coming up with innovative and creative ideas around how to use data generated through the website, app and other channels such as CRM, third party, transactional and warehouse to do this.
This role still requires hands on predictive analysis and modelling skills (SQL as a minimum, ideally experience with R or Python), as with any opportunity that arises through change, you will need to bridge the gap between what they are currently doing now and where they are aiming to get to – working with the Head of Analytics to build out capabilities and eventually a bigger team. So, there is huge opportunity for personal and technical growth and development within this role, as the business accelerates it’s data function into the modern age, embracing AI and machine learning techniques where appropriate. They have already invested in a cloud based platform (GCP) and are very open to using open source tech such as R and Python for more advanced analytical solutions and projects – all of which will be led by you, from a product perspective.
The culture is fast paced, young and agile, and with double digit growth YOY, this trail blazing brand continues to lead the way in fast fashion and there is an agenda to make the brand unique and distinctive, by tapping into the data and through the use of analytics and data science.
Skills and experience required:
Educated to at least degree level in a numerate subject; Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Machine Learning, Computer Science etc.
Ideally experience of working in a digital environment
A strong background in commercial and product analytics, preferably in retail or fashion
Strong programming skills using SQL as a minimum, plus, ideally, experience using R or Python for more advanced programming and modelling
An understanding around demand forecasting, supply chain and logistics, as well as sales performance and product related challengesd
A problem solving approach, ability to apply analytics to improve product performance and customer engagement
A curious nature, and inquisitive nature plus an ability to build strong relationships with direct reports and senior level stakeholders"

THE OPPORTUNITY
With investment from the top into data and all its uses, this is an exciting time to be joining the company and they look to understand and explore their customer’s behaviours and relationships with the brand in more detail than ever before. As always, there is the challenge of educating and liberating existing stakeholders across many different functions within this fashion giant as to the possibilities of data driven decision making and actionable insights - which is where this role comes in.
With investment from the top into data and all its uses, this is an exciting time to be joining the company and they look to understand and explore their customer’s behaviours and relationships with the brand in more detail than ever before. As always, there is the challenge of educating and liberating existing stakeholders across many different functions within this fashion giant as to the possibilities of data driven decision making and actionable insights - which is where this role comes in.
Working as part of a team of data experts across customer analytics, product, marketing, finance and customer service, you will focus on delivering reports, self service analytics and actionable insights around customer and marketing performance for the group. You will have one direct report initially and will both work to build relationships with key stakeholders in many departments to understand their needs, challenges and potential for using data to improve decision making around customer behaviour and engagement, churn and retention, acquisition as well as marketing performance across multiple channels (predominantly digital). In this brand new role, we’ll need people with natural intellectual curiosity to go beyond the basics and establish the best way of measuring and improving marketing performance through test and learn frameworks and coming up with innovative and creative ideas around engaging and targeting customers, use data generated through the website, app and other channels such as CRM, third party, transactional and warehouse to do this.
This role still requires hands on customer and marketing analytics skills (SQL as a minimum), as with any opportunity that arises through change, you will need to bridge the gap between what they are currently doing now and where they are aiming to get to - working to build out capabilities and eventually a bigger team. So, there is huge opportunity for personal and technical growth and development within this role, as the business accelerates it’s data function into the modern age, embracing AI and machine learning techniques where appropriate. They have already invested in a cloud based platform (GCP) and are very open to using open source tech such as R and Python for more advanced analytical solutions and projects - all of which will be led by you, from a customer and marketing perspective.
The culture is fast paced, young and agile, and with double digit growth YOY, this trail blazer continues to lead the way in fast fashion. But with the inevitable slowing of such growth on the horizon, there is an agenda to make the brand unique and distinctive, by tapping into the data and through the use of analytics and data science.
Skills and experience required:
Educated to at least degree level in a numerate subject; Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Machine Learning, Computer Science etc.
A strong background in customer and marketing analytics
Strong programming skills using SQL as a minimum for campaign analysis, measurement and targeting (campaign selections)
A problem solving approach, ability to apply analytics to improve customer understanding and in turn CRM and marketing campaign performance
A curious nature, and inquisitive nature plus an ability to build strong relationships with direct reports and senior level stakeholders"

Data Scientist
Data Scientist required for a fast growing and forward-thinking Consultancy as they continue to win new and interesting data projects.
Your new role …
You'll be joining a really talented team of Data Scientists, Engineers, Architects and a wider team of Product Mangers, Software Engineers and Consultants.
No need to be worried about this being another data science role with no interesting projects, or even worse no data! The team have plenty of work to be getting on with and as they are a Consultancy and trusted partner across a variety of industries, you will have the chance to be involved in an array of work. This includes the financial services sector looking at machine learning for crime detection and anti-money laundering to large scale NHS projects using your data skills for good.
You …
You'll be well versed as a Data Scientist, ideally having worked in a customer or business facing role. A huge part of this role will be talking to a selection of stakeholders from super technical to complete non-techies. You need to be able to explain your solutions to both seamlessly.
I won't patronise you here by saying you'll need experience of Python, SQL or R - you're a data scientist after all …
An appreciation of various cloud providers would be pretty beneficial though as they work in various environments depending on the customer with a recent push in GCP projects, but as you'd expect plenty of Azure and AWS work as well. A certification in one or more of these would be a bit of a cherry on top.
The company …
A boutique data consultancy within a larger organisation, delivering some impressive and complex projects in various sectors.
You will have the opportunity to progress your career with well defined bandings and regular feedback.
The Senior Management are still very hands on and not in a micro-management, can't let go sort of way, they are still very passionate about the success of the business.
The Small Print … (AKA salary & benefits)
You will be working remotely initially - obviously, but in the future, there is an expectation to be on client site up to 4 times a week, which can be UK wide. This is a Consulting gig, so you'll need to be comfortable with that.
In reality, they will try spread the work as locally as possible and there is a good chance a lot of customers will be happy with remote work going forward.
But you need to be prepared to travel as part of the role.
Salary wise, there is a wide range on offer as they have multiple roles, but to help you drum down a bit, somewhere between £45-80k + benefits.
Please do hit apply and contact Tom Edmondson at Cathcart Associates for a more detailed chat on the role, the company and what you are looking for."

Help tackle world hunger!
Software Engineer with expertise in back-end development and building data architectures needed
KEY EXPERIENCE / SKILLS REQUIRED:
Demonstrable experience in Software Engineering (this role would likely suit somebody who considers themselves to be at a mid or senior level).
Ability to work across the full-stack in a Linux and Open Source Environment using the likes of Python and JavaScript, but with a particular leaning towards back-end and data engineering.
Expertise in developing and delivering data architectures and platforms; in particular, knowledge of modern 'Big Data' tools such as Hadoop, Spark, etc, would be beneficial (although not essential).
ROLE OVERVIEW:
If you're an accomplished Software Engineer with particular expertise in Data Engineering, this could be a rare opportunity to demonstrate your skills in ways that will contribute to improving lives and the planet we live on.
A leading light in the UK AgriTech scene, this software & data analytics company is on a mission to devise and develop solutions for the AgriFood sector that will lead to greater food productivity, environmental sustainability and more.
Working within a team of Full-Stack Software Engineers, your remit will be to become one of the main authorities in the team when it comes to developing and building data architectures. Therefore, you could be a 'mid level' Developer looking to take this step up, or a more experienced Developer who is already able to take on a 'senior' role.
You will be part of a small and flexible team that is happy to 'muck in' on various tasks when required; therefore, whilst specialising in Data Engineering, you must also be versatile and happy to get stuck into more general Software Engineering and programming tasks as and when needed."

Tableau, SQL, Data Analyst
Data Analyst
My client, an industry leading Professional Services company, is looking for a Data Analyst with strong Tableau and SQL skills to join their growing team.
You will be responsible for supporting the Insight Manager and Data Engineers with delivery of actionable insight on the back of Data Analysis you conduct. You would be involved in the optimisation, development & implementation of databases, data analytics, but will not get involved in the ETL / Data Engineering side - that is for another team. Your role will be to make sense of that data and tell a story to a Data Led organisation to help them improve how they operate across multiple areas of the organisation.
This is a role that requires great communication skills to engage with the business and stakeholders, in addition to strong Technical skills.
Because of the various databases, you would need to have strong SQL skills to interrogate the database
This will be put to the test during the interview process.
Whilst they also use Alteryx, the greater flexibility or SQL will be utilised more in future, so Alteryx is only a nice to have.
The first 6 months will be spent sorting out their current Tableau dashboards in operation (there are many that overlap, and are difficult to maintain, so must be streamlined to increase impact).
The key thing with this role is that you need Dashboarding skills, but also the ability to tell a story using data, and demonstrate actioned insight you have offered previous places of work.
It is critical that you have demonstrable examples of your Tableau dashboards to share in interview - either a portfolio or screenshots, as the design and presentation of data is very important in this position.
Whilst you would obviously be working from home in the short term, longer term they would like you to still interact personally with the stakeholders in the business, and so would need to be in around 3 days a week in the office - based in Central London, so remote workers are not encouraged to apply.
If you are keen to work in a stable and secure organisation that has some great data to work with then please get in touch ASAP with your CV and portfolio (for your dashboards).

Incredibly diverse project base working with household names.
Outstanding team culture, small team with lots of progression.
Full remote for good!

We’re helping a data-led marketing agency who work with some seriously impressive brands to find an Application Developer to join their delivery team. This role is fully remote though their HQ is in Scotland, and they also have an office in Bristol should you want to be surrounded by a team. Boasting some huge household names as part of their client base, this role sits in a small but growing team alongside a talented bunch of Data Engineering, Tech Support and Project Delivery specialists. If you’re a developer with a passion for data, I want to hear from you!

What skills you’ll need

Commercial C# experience and understanding of the wider MS stack. Any knowledge of Python would be useful.
Knowledge of at least one cloud platform, preferably Azure/AWS but open to Google too.
Preference for back-end development, appreciation for the importance of data.
Ability to test your own work.
Significant awareness of SQL.
Experience with Git/TFS source control and Agile.
Solid communication skills, comfortable being in a client-facing environment.
What you’ll be doing

This role sits in the business’ delivery team. You’d be working alongside their Senior App Developer to create a variety of applications which support the delivery of solutions to an impressive client base of household names. The role leans much more to the back-end with most projects being cloud-based on AWS, though they’re happy to cross-train from a different platform if needed. The business is data-led in their approach so lots of the project work will be centred on data development, involved in high-level data pipelines and insight. Being an agency-style environment you could be working on several projects concurrently so you’ll need to bring an adaptable mindset that will allow you to jump between different tech and styles of development on a regular basis. The client base is spread across various industries including POS, Print, Automotive, TV and more. There is ambitious growth plans in place so you could certainly look to progress into a more senior role quite quickly.

What you’ll get in return for your talents

On top of a competitive salary and rapid scope for progression, this role offers 100% remote working with an occasional trip to the office, and if you’d prefer to be in an office you can work out of either of their Edinburgh or Bristol offices! They work with a global client base of seriously impressive household brands which will only support you to become more versatile as a Developer moving forward. Diverse team, multiple opportunities for R&D, constant variety and change. What’s not to love!

Data Engineer

Data Engineer required for a fast growing and forward-thinking Consultancy as they continue to win new and interesting data projects.

Your new role …
You'll be joining a really talented team of Data Engineers, Scientists, Architects and a wider team of Product Mangers, Software Engineers and Consultants.
No need to be worried about this being another Data Engineering role with no interesting projects, or even worse no data! The team have plenty of work to be getting on with and as they are a Consultancy and trusted partner across a variety of industries, you will have the chance to be involved in an array of work.

You …
You'll be well versed as a Data Engineer, ideally having worked in a customer or business facing role before. A huge part of this role will be talking to a selection of stakeholders from super technical to complete non-techies. You need to be able to explain your solutions to both seamlessly.
I won't patronise you here by saying you'll need experience of Python or SQL- you're a data engineer after all …
An appreciation of various cloud providers would be pretty beneficial though as they work in various environments depending on the customer with a recent push in GCP projects, but as you'd expect plenty of Azure and AWS work as well. A certification in one or more of these would be a bit of a cherry on top.

The company …
A boutique data consultancy within a larger organisation, delivering some impressive and complex projects in various sectors.
You will have the opportunity to progress your career with well defined bandings and regular feedback.
The Senior Management are still very hands on and not in a micro-management, can't let go sort of way, they are still very passionate about the success of the business.

The Small Print … (AKA salary & benefits)
You will be working remotely initially - obviously, but in the future, there is an expectation to be on client site up to 4 times a week, which can be UK wide. This is a Consulting gig, so you'll need to be comfortable with that.
In reality, they will try spread the work as locally as possible and there is a good chance a lot of customers will be happy with remote work going forward.
But you need to be prepared to travel as part of the role.

Salary wise, there is a wide range on offer as they have multiple roles, but to help you drum down a bit, somewhere between £45-80k + benefits.

Please do hit apply and contact Tom Edmondson at Cathcart Associates for a more detailed chat on the role, the company and what you are looking for."

Boasting some huge household names as part of their client base, this role sits in a small but growing team alongside a talented bunch of Data Engineering, Tech Support and Project Delivery specialists. If you’re a developer with a passion for data, I want to hear from you!

What skills you’ll need

The role leans much more to the back-end with most projects being cloud-based on AWS, though they’re happy to cross-train from a different platform if needed.

Being an agency-style environment you could be working on several projects concurrently so you’ll need to bring an adaptable mindset that will allow you to jump between different tech and styles of development on a regular basis. The client base is spread across various industries including POS, Print, Automotive, TV and more.

Backend Software Engineer (Node.js/AWS/Agile) - London
£60k + flexi/remote working
My client, an award-winning Publishing House is looking to hire four experienced Backend Software Engineers (Node.js) to join an agile development team that is helping evolve their core Digital News products.
The role:
They are looking for engineers to help work on improving their digital presence, from enhancing the reader experience through to improving the editorial workflow. Their main strategic projects at the moment include evolving their digital platforms to support the next generation of news, and improving their sites to reflect each brand’s individuality.
They are looking for people who care deeply about the code they write while at the same time are able to bridge the gap between the technical and the business areas of the company effectively.
They want people who look further than the technical aspects of the work and care deeply about the human aspect of their products. You will be responsible for designing, testing and implementing improvements to their news products, and the work you do here will ultimately be consumed by millions of people.
Tech Stack
The main products use a Java-based CMS, running in Tomcat and hosted in AWS. This is used for both content creation and delivering the presentation layer for their websites. The trend in recent years has been away from a Java monolith towards Node.js based systems and microservices. Theu are currently planning a more extensive re-platform which will accelerate this trend towards cloud native event-driven architectures. If you’re enthusiastic and have some experience in working with such technologies, and know or are willing to learn about developing systems at their considerable scale then we want to hear from you.
Their preferred way to run application code has become to run it either in a Docker container running in ECS or in a Lambda function. They extensively leverage other AWS services including RDS, CloudFront, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, CloudWatch and so on. They are strong believers in DevOps principles and infrastructure as code, and they are continuously trying to improve in that direction.
The current frontend is primarily built in vanilla JS within an ES module structure, Sass for CSS and Pug templates for producing HTML. As with the backend stack they are looking to re-architect and modernise the frontend presentation layer
Your experience
The ideal candidate for this position will:
Be experienced in Node.js development with an interest in working across the stack.
Be experienced in building cloud native systems in AWS.
Have a strong understanding of HTTP, caching and how the web works.
Have experience with backend build systems and with automated testing.
Work collaboratively within an agile web development team, be self-directed and be happy to work on their own initiative.
Any of the following would also be useful but not mandatory:
Knowledge of GraphQL.
Experience with React / full stack development.
Experience with Infrastructure as Code.
Involvement with high traffic systems.
Experience in Java application development.
Experience configuring CI/CD pipelines.
Experience with Data Engineering.
